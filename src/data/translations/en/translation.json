      "training": "💻 I discovered that web development was a thing in 2018. Out of curiosity, I took some free courses on OpenClassrooms and just like that, I made my very first websites. I was excited - and still am - to find out all the things that I could create with a bit of logic and creativity. I registered at O'Clock school for an intensive six month remote training course. During the first three months, I learned the basics of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL). \n Then, as I felt really attracted by front-end and user interfaces, I chose React for my specialization course. The final month, I had the great opportunity to create a project from scratch and work with five other developers. From project management to final product development, following the scrum framework (sprints, daily meetings, retrospective), this project allowed me to apply the various skills I learned from the previous months.",
